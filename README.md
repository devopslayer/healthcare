# Healthcare Dashboard UI

A responsive healthcare dashboard interface built using Vite, React (JavaScript), standard CSS, Bootstrap, React Icons and Recharts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

- If you are using HTTPS, the command will be:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare.git
```

-- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

- If you are using SSH, the command will be:

```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/healthcare.git
```

-- Again, replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
   cd healthcare
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
   npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
   npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- Vite + React (JavaScript)
- CSS (Global + Component Scoped)
- Bootstrap and Custom CSS (for layout and responsiveness)
- React Icons (for UI icons)
- Recharts (for data visualization)

## Notes

- The layout is static for now, using placeholder images and dummy data.
- Components are modular and can be reused.
- Sidebar toggles based on screen size.
